This post summarizes my new project: the design and development of an **interactive Supply Chain Control Tower dashboard** built with **R** and **Shiny**.

The goal of the project is to show how data visualization can transform fragmented operational records into a clear, end-to-end view of supply chain performance. Instead of treating production, shipping, inventory, and sales as isolated steps, the dashboard brings them into one connected analytical system.

## Project Motivation

In many real-world operations, managers can see only a portion of the supply chain at a time. That limited visibility makes it harder to identify where delays, bottlenecks, and financial inefficiencies begin.

This project focuses on a simulated **medical device supply chain** with four sequential nodes:

1. Manufacturer
2. Supplier
3. Seller
4. Hospital

The central idea is to demonstrate the **bullwhip effect**, where small changes in final demand at the hospital level can generate much larger fluctuations upstream in production and inventory.

## Data Design and Structure

The project uses **synthetic but statistically realistic data** rather than proprietary business data. That choice makes the system easier to design, explain, and evaluate while preserving realistic operational logic.

Each device-level record is linked by a unique device ID and includes timestamps for:

1. Manufacturing
2. Shipment
3. Warehouse arrival
4. Sale
5. Hospital deployment

The dataset also includes financial measures at each stage of the chain:

1. Manufacturer production cost and wholesale price
2. Supplier markup to the seller
3. Seller final price to the hospital

This structure allows the dashboard to track both the **physical movement of goods** and the **economic flow of margins**.

## Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard is organized into three views, each built around a different managerial question.

### 1. Executive Overview

The first view gives a high-level snapshot of system health. It includes key indicators such as:

1. Total devices currently in transit
2. Stagnant inventory across supply chain nodes
3. Average end-to-end lead time
4. Current-quarter gross profit

This section is designed to answer a basic question quickly: is the supply chain operating efficiently right now?

### 2. Flow and Bottleneck Analysis

The second view uses a **Sankey diagram** to visualize movement from manufacturer to supplier, seller, and hospital.

The flow widths represent the volume of inventory moving through the system. If inventory starts accumulating heavily at one node, the bottleneck becomes visually obvious.

I also designed this view to support two modes:

1. **Unit Volume Mode** for physical inventory flow
2. **Capital Mode** for financial exposure tied up in inventory

This makes the dashboard useful not only for operations analysis but also for understanding how much capital is trapped in slow-moving stock.

### 3. Forecasting and Predictive Profitability

The third view extends the dashboard beyond descriptive analytics.

Using hospital consumption as the proxy for final demand, the project applies an **ARIMA forecasting model** to estimate next-quarter demand. That forecast is then adjusted for downstream inventory already held by suppliers and sellers.

The resulting production logic is:

> Required Production = Forecasted Hospital Demand - Existing Downstream Inventory

This part of the dashboard demonstrates how stronger end-to-end visibility can reduce overproduction risk and improve profit planning.

## Why This Project Matters

What interests me most about this project is the combination of:

1. simulation design,
2. operational storytelling through visualization,
3. and financial reasoning in decision support.

The project is not meant as a production enterprise tool, but it serves as a clear conceptual prototype for how integrated dashboards can improve supply chain decisions.

It also highlights a broader point: better visualization does not just make data prettier. It can make system-wide inefficiencies easier to detect, easier to explain, and easier to act on.

## Closing Thoughts

This project helped me think more carefully about how data products should bridge technical modeling and practical business decisions.

By combining synthetic data, layered visualization, and forecasting, the Supply Chain Control Tower becomes both a useful analytical exercise and a compact example of data-driven operational design.

I plan to continue refining this work by improving interaction design, extending the forecasting logic, and exploring more realistic scenario analysis.
